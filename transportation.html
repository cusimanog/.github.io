            <div>Many people prefer the comfort of taxis when traveling at night. They run all day and are white with a red stripe, and the city's crest and their license number on the side. They can be hailed in the street when the green light is on. Otherwise, they can be found at taxi ranks or you can order them by telephone using the radio taxi service. Tariffs are displayed inside the taxis and comprise the minimum fare, flag-down charge, kilometer charge and other extras such as night service, public holidays, and station or airport service. The total cost for the ride is displayed on a meter.</div>

            <div>Madrid’s local bus company is known as EMT. They offer thousands of blue buses serving more than 100 lines between the downtown area and residential neighborhoods. Normal buses run daily from 6 a.m. until 23:30, every 5 to 15 minutes depending on the line and time of day. At night, a limited service of nocturnal buses known as búhos (“owls”) runs from 23:45 until 6 a.m. the next morning, every 15-30 minutes. This is the ideal option for public transportation in Madrid if you’ll be out and about until the wee hours of the morning!

            <div>Madrid’s commuter rail service is called Madrid Cercanías and it connects various parts of the city and the main towns in the Community of Madrid and other nearby provinces.
                    Cercanía trains are connected to the main metro stations in the city and sometimes can be the fastest way of getting from one part of Madrid to another, especially in its metropolitan area
